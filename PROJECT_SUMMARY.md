# Quantum Blocks - Project Summary

## 🎯 What Was Built

I've successfully created a complete **MVP (Minimum Viable Product)** of "Quantum Blocks" - a 2D falling block puzzle game for Android using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose.

## 📱 Game Features Implemented

### Core Gameplay
- ✅ **Single T-piece tetromino** that spawns at the top center
- ✅ **Automatic falling** at constant speed with level progression
- ✅ **Manual controls** for left/right movement and rotation
- ✅ **Soft drop** functionality for rapid falling
- ✅ **Collision detection** and piece locking
- ✅ **Line clearing** when rows are completely filled
- ✅ **Game over detection** when pieces reach the top
- ✅ **Restart functionality** after game over

### UI/UX
- ✅ **Responsive design** that adapts to different screen sizes
- ✅ **Portrait mode** optimization
- ✅ **Clean, modern UI** with Material3 design
- ✅ **Touch-friendly controls** with clear button labels
- ✅ **Real-time score and level display**
- ✅ **Visual feedback** with distinct colors for pieces vs locked blocks

### Technical Implementation
- ✅ **MVVM architecture** with ViewModel and StateFlow
- ✅ **Jetpack Compose UI** with custom Canvas drawing
- ✅ **Coroutines** for game loop and timing
- ✅ **Immutable data models** for game state
- ✅ **Proper separation of concerns** (model, engine, viewmodel, ui)

## 🎮 How to Play

1. **Objective**: Clear horizontal lines by filling them completely
2. **Controls**:
   - **←** Move piece left
   - **→** Move piece right
   - **↻** Rotate piece 90° clockwise
   - **↓** Soft drop (rapid falling)
3. **Scoring**: Points for clearing lines, with bonus for higher levels
4. **Progression**: Level increases every 1000 points, speed increases
5. **Game Over**: When new pieces can't be placed at the top

## 🚀 How to Run

### Prerequisites
- Android Studio Arctic Fox or later
- Android SDK API 24+
- Java 8 or later

### Steps
1. **Open in Android Studio**:
   ```bash
   # Open the project folder in Android Studio
   # Or use: open -a "Android Studio" .
   ```

2. **Sync Project**:
   - Android Studio will automatically sync Gradle files
   - Wait for dependencies to download

3. **Run the App**:
   - Connect an Android device or start an emulator
   - Click the "Run" button (green play icon)
   - The app will install and launch automatically

### Alternative: Command Line
```bash
# Make gradlew executable (if needed)
chmod +x gradlew

# Build the project
./gradlew build

# Install on connected device
./gradlew installDebug
```

## 🔧 Technical Highlights

### Game Engine
- **60fps game loop** using coroutines and Flow
- **Collision detection** with grid-based validation
- **Piece rotation** with proper boundary checking
- **Line clearing** with cascading block movement
- **Progressive difficulty** with speed increases

### UI Architecture
- **Composable-based UI** with proper state management
- **Canvas drawing** for efficient game board rendering
- **Responsive layout** that maintains aspect ratio
- **Material3 theming** with dark mode support

### Code Quality
- **Immutable data structures** for predictable state
- **Separation of concerns** with clear module boundaries
- **Kotlin best practices** with proper null safety
- **Comprehensive documentation** with KDoc comments
