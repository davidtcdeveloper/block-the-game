# Quantum Blocks MVP - Original Prompt & Implementation

## Original Prompt

```
# BUILD PROMPT: "Quantum Blocks" – MVP (First Iteration)

## GOAL
Build a minimal viable product (MVP) for "Quantum Blocks" - a 2D falling block puzzle game for Android using Kotlin and Jetpack Compose.

## TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS
- **Platform:** Android only
- **Language:** Kotlin
- **UI Framework:** Jetpack Compose
- **Target:** Modern Android devices (API 24+)

## CORE GAME STRUCTURE

### Layout
- **Board:** Fills entire screen except for controls area at bottom
- **Grid:** 2D rectangular board that adapts to device screen size (maintain aspect ratio)
- **Controls:** Fixed control panel at bottom of screen
- **Orientation:** Portrait mode only

### Basic Gameplay Loop
1. A single piece type (simple 4-block tetromino) spawns at top center of board
2. Piece falls downward automatically at constant speed
3. Player uses bottom controls to move/rotate piece
4. When piece touches bottom or another piece, it locks in place
5. When a horizontal row is completely filled, it disappears
6. Game ends when pieces reach the top of the board
7. New piece spawns after previous piece locks

### Controls (Bottom Panel)
- **Move Left Button:** Moves falling piece one cell left
- **Move Right Button:** Moves falling piece one cell right  
- **Rotate Button:** Rotates falling piece 90° clockwise
- **Drop Button:** Makes piece fall faster (soft drop)

### Piece Design
- **Single Shape:** Use only one standard tetromino shape (e.g., T-piece or L-piece)
- **Single Material:** All pieces behave identically - no physics, materials, or special effects
- **Standard Locking:** Piece locks immediately when it can't fall further (classic Tetris behavior)

### Win/Lose Conditions
- **Continue Playing:** Game continues indefinitely
- **Game Over:** When a newly spawned piece cannot fit at the top
- **Line Clearing:** Completed horizontal rows disappear, blocks above fall down

### Visual Requirements
- Simple, clean design with solid colors
- Clear grid lines
- Distinct colors for pieces vs. background vs. locked blocks
- Responsive layout that works on different Android screen sizes

## AGENT TASKS
- Implement responsive Jetpack Compose UI that fills screen appropriately
- Create bottom control panel with four clearly labeled buttons
- Implement basic falling piece mechanics with grid-based movement
- Add line clearing logic when rows are completed
- Handle game over state when pieces reach top
- Ensure smooth 60fps gameplay with proper game loop timing
- Test on different Android screen sizes for layout adaptation

## FUTURE ITERATIONS (Summary Only)

**Iteration 2:** Multiple piece shapes and basic scoring system  
**Iteration 3:** Different material types (wood, metal, ice) with basic physics  
**Iteration 4:** Quantum effects (phase blocks, entangled pieces)  
**Iteration 5:** Advanced physics simulation (sliding, bouncing, instability)  
**Iteration 6:** Level progression and structured challenges  
**Iteration 7:** Visual effects, animations, and polished UI  
**Iteration 8:** Audio system and adaptive soundtrack  
**Iteration 9:** Daily challenges and special game modes  
**Iteration 10:** Performance optimization and advanced features

**END OF MVP PROMPT**  
Focus solely on delivering a playable, stable version with the core falling-block mechanic before adding any complexity.

## Implementation Reasoning & Decisions

### 1. Project Structure & Architecture

**Decision**: MVVM Architecture with Jetpack Compose
- **Reasoning**: Modern Android development best practices
- **Benefits**: Separation of concerns, testability, lifecycle awareness
- **Implementation**: ViewModel + StateFlow for reactive UI updates

**Decision**: Package Structure
```
com.quantumblocks.game/
├── model/     # Data models (immutable)
├── engine/    # Game logic (pure functions)
├── viewmodel/ # State management
└── ui/        # Compose components
```

### 2. Game Engine Design

**Decision**: Pure Function Approach
- **Reasoning**: Predictable state changes, easier testing
- **Implementation**: GameEngine class with stateless methods
- **Benefits**: No side effects, deterministic behavior

**Decision**: Coroutines for Game Loop
- **Reasoning**: Non-blocking, efficient for Android
- **Implementation**: Flow-based game loop with configurable delays
- **Benefits**: Smooth 60fps gameplay, proper lifecycle management

### 3. Data Models

**Decision**: Immutable Data Classes
```kotlin
@Immutable
data class GameState(
    val board: List<List<Boolean>>,
    val currentPiece: Piece?,
    val gameOver: Boolean,
    val score: Int,
    val level: Int
)
```
- **Reasoning**: Thread safety, predictable state changes
- **Benefits**: No race conditions, easier debugging

**Decision**: Position-based Coordinate System
```kotlin
data class Position(val row: Int, val col: Int)
```
- **Reasoning**: Simple 2D grid representation
- **Benefits**: Easy collision detection, clear boundaries

### 4. UI Implementation

**Decision**: Canvas-based Game Board
- **Reasoning**: Efficient rendering for game grid
- **Implementation**: Custom DrawScope functions for grid, blocks, pieces
- **Benefits**: Smooth performance, precise control over rendering

**Decision**: Responsive Layout
- **Reasoning**: Works on different screen sizes
- **Implementation**: AspectRatio modifier with weight-based layout
- **Benefits**: Consistent gameplay across devices

### 5. Game Mechanics

**Decision**: T-piece Tetromino
- **Reasoning**: Good balance of complexity and recognizability
- **Implementation**: 4-block shape with rotation center
- **Benefits**: Demonstrates rotation mechanics effectively

**Decision**: Grid-based Movement
- **Reasoning**: Classic Tetris behavior
- **Implementation**: Position-based movement with boundary checking
- **Benefits**: Predictable, easy to understand

**Decision**: Progressive Difficulty
- **Reasoning**: Keeps game engaging
- **Implementation**: Level-based speed increases
- **Benefits**: Scalable difficulty curve

### 6. Technical Implementation Details

**Game Loop Timing**:
```kotlin
const val INITIAL_FALL_DELAY_MS = 1000L
const val SOFT_DROP_DELAY_MS = 50L
const val LEVEL_SPEED_MULTIPLIER = 0.9f
```

**Board Dimensions**:
```kotlin
val board: List<List<Boolean>> = List(20) { List(10) { false } }
```
- **Reasoning**: Standard Tetris proportions (2:1 ratio)
- **Benefits**: Familiar gameplay, good for mobile screens

**Scoring System**:
```kotlin
val newScore = score + (linesToClear.size * 100 * level)
val newLevel = (newScore / 1000) + 1
```
- **Reasoning**: Rewards skill and persistence
- **Benefits**: Clear progression, motivating gameplay

### 7. UI/UX Decisions

**Color Scheme**:
- **Background**: Black (classic game feel)
- **Grid**: Gray with transparency (subtle guidance)
- **Locked Blocks**: Blue (clear distinction)
- **Active Piece**: Cyan (high visibility)
- **Borders**: White (clean definition)

**Control Layout**:
- **Position**: Bottom of screen (thumb-friendly)
- **Size**: Equal weight distribution
- **Labels**: Unicode symbols (← → ↻ ↓)
- **Feedback**: Material3 button styling

**Responsive Design**:
- **Aspect Ratio**: Maintains 10:20 grid proportions
- **Weight Distribution**: Game board gets most space
- **Padding**: Consistent 16dp margins
- **Orientation**: Portrait lock in manifest

### 8. Error Handling & Edge Cases

**Collision Detection**:
```kotlin
fun isPositionValid(position: Position): Boolean {
    return position.row >= 0 && 
           position.row < boardHeight && 
           position.col >= 0 && 
           position.col < boardWidth &&
           !board[position.row][position.col]
}
```

**Game Over Detection**:
```kotlin
return if (gameState.canPlacePiece(newPiece)) {
    gameState.copy(currentPiece = newPiece)
} else {
    gameState.copy(gameOver = true)
}
```

**Line Clearing**:
```kotlin
val linesToClear = board.mapIndexedNotNull { index, row ->
    if (row.all { it }) index else null
}
```

### 9. Performance Considerations
